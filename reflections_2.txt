Q - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    A hidden folder containing metadata about the files in the repository is created. 
	
Q - How is the staging area different from the working directory and 
    the repository? What value do you think it offers?	
A - The staging area is a selective snapshot of the working directory, allows you to
    configure the commit before finalising it with the commit.
