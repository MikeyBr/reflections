Q - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A - When collaborating with other developers and as a secure off site backup.

Q - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically  
    stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A - It would be impossible developing with changes magically appearing in the file from other
    contributors as you develop.
